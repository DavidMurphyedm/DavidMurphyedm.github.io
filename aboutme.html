                <p>Hi, my name is David, and I'm a Web Developer from Edmonton, Alberta. I Graduated in 2024 with a Diploma in Web Design and Development from N.A.I.T. I am 45 years old, a father to four wonderful children ages 9,6, 3 and 1 and a beautiful wife. They keep me on my toes and literally get me up in the morning. I'm a former Red Seal Mechanic and switched careers due to a shoulder injury. One of the things I loved about being a mechanic was providing excellent customer service, being a team player and coming up with solutions to complex problems, traits that I think carry over well in Web Design. I am passionate about building visually stunning websites that are rich in content. In My Spare time, when I'm not shuffling between hockey rinks, I enjoy outdoor sports such as Skateboarding, Snowboarding, Mountain Biking, and Disc Golf. I also enjoy listening to Metal music and playing guitar when the weather is terrible. Thank you for taking the time to look ay my page. I hope you enjoy it.
